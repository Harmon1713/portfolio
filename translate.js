      goldSkills: "R (caret, magrittr, dplyr, tidyr, ggplot2, lmtest, popbio, e1071, readxl)",
      goldContent: "In this project, logistic regression was employed to predict the presence of gold in a given location based on antimony levels. The analysis involved the use of several R packages, including caret for creating the confusion matrix, dplyr and tidyr for data manipulation, and ggplot2 for visualization. The model was built using the glm function, specifying a binomial family to handle the binary nature of the response variable (presence of gold). After fitting the model, predictions were made, and a confusion matrix was generated to assess the model's accuracy. Additionally, diagnostic checks were performed to evaluate model assumptions, including the Durbin-Watson test for autocorrelation and the inspection of residuals and influence measures. Visualizations were created to assess the relationship between the log-odds (logit) and predictor variables, aiding in the interpretation of the logistic regression model. The results indicated that higher antimony levels are associated with an increased likelihood of finding gold, as shown by the positive coefficient for antimony in the logistic regression model. The model's performance, as evaluated by the confusion matrix, suggested it was reasonably accurate in predicting gold presence, making it a useful tool for geologists in identifying potential gold deposits.",

      goldContent: "En este proyecto, se utilizó la regresión logística para predecir la presencia de oro en una ubicación dada basada en los niveles de antimonio. El análisis involucró el uso de varios paquetes de R, incluyendo caret para crear la matriz de confusión, dplyr y tidyr para la manipulación de datos, y ggplot2 para la visualización. El modelo se construyó utilizando la función glm, especificando una familia binomial para manejar la naturaleza binaria de la variable de respuesta (presencia de oro). Después de ajustar el modelo, se realizaron predicciones y se generó una matriz de confusión para evaluar la precisión del modelo. Además, se realizaron pruebas diagnósticas para evaluar los supuestos del modelo, incluyendo la prueba de Durbin-Watson para la autocorrelación y la inspección de los residuos y las medidas de influencia. Se crearon visualizaciones para evaluar la relación entre las probabilidades (logit) y las variables predictoras, lo que ayudó en la interpretación del modelo de regresión logística. Los resultados indicaron que niveles más altos de antimonio están asociados con una mayor probabilidad de encontrar oro, como se muestra en el coeficiente positivo para el antimonio en el modelo de regresión logística. El rendimiento del modelo, evaluado por la matriz de confusión, sugirió que era razonablemente preciso en la predicción de la presencia de oro, lo que lo convierte en una herramienta útil para los geólogos en la identificación de posibles depósitos de oro.",

      goldContent: "Neste projeto, foi utilizada a regressão logística para prever a presença de ouro em uma determinada localização com base nos níveis de antimônio. A análise envolveu o uso de vários pacotes R, incluindo caret para criar a matriz de confusão, dplyr e tidyr para manipulação de dados, e ggplot2 para visualização. O modelo foi construído utilizando a função glm, especificando uma família binomial para lidar com a natureza binária da variável de resposta (presença de ouro). Após ajustar o modelo, foram feitas previsões e uma matriz de confusão foi gerada para avaliar a precisão do modelo. Além disso, foram realizados testes diagnósticos para avaliar as suposições do modelo, incluindo o teste de Durbin-Watson para autocorrelação e a inspeção dos resíduos e das medidas de influência. Foram criadas visualizações para avaliar a relação entre as chances (logit) e as variáveis preditoras, auxiliando na interpretação do modelo de regressão logística. Os resultados indicaram que níveis mais altos de antimônio estão associados a uma maior probabilidade de encontrar ouro, conforme demonstrado pelo coeficiente positivo para antimônio no modelo de regressão logística. O desempenho do modelo, avaliado pela matriz de confusão, sugeriu que era razoavelmente preciso na previsão da presença de ouro, tornando-se uma ferramenta útil para geólogos na identificação de possíveis depósitos de ouro.",

      biomechanicsmodalcontent: "O estudo 'O Estudo da Biomecânica de Lesões no Pulso/Mão e Tornozelo/Pé para Acrobacias Usando o MatScan' envolveu a utilização de uma gama de habilidades técnicas integrais para a pesquisa biomecânica e análise de dados. Essas habilidades incluíram a configuração e calibração do sistema MatScan para obter medições precisas de pressão durante exercícios de acrobacia, e o uso de software especializado (Tekscan Research 6.70) para capturar e analisar dados detalhados de pressão, identificando áreas de alto risco de lesões. O estudo também envolveu realizar avaliações biomecânicas abrangentes para correlacionar as tendências de pressão com possíveis lesões. A gestão e análise de gravações de vídeo, combinadas com a interpretação sistemática de dados, demonstraram competência na aplicação de ferramentas avançadas de pesquisa e metodologias para melhorar a prevenção de lesões e o desempenho em esportes.",

      researchMTS:"Pesquisa: usa Material Testing System (MTS)",
      bonemodalcontent: "No artigo de pesquisa 'Comparando as Propriedades Mecânicas do Osso Esponjoso entre Osso de Fêmur de Porco, Osso de Fêmur de Veado e Osso de Úmero Humano,' foram utilizadas uma variedade de habilidades técnicas. O estudo envolveu pesquisa avançada de biomateriais e técnicas de testes mecânicos, particularmente focando no estresse axial, deformação e módulo de Young das amostras de osso. O Sistema de Testes de Materiais (MTS) foi utilizado para aplicar forças de compressão controladas às amostras, simulando condições de estresse do mundo real e gerando dados detalhados sobre o comportamento do osso sob carga. O processo exigiu uma preparação precisa das amostras, incluindo corte e medição das amostras de osso, e realização de medições de deslocamento e força para calcular o estresse e a deformação. A análise de dados foi realizada usando métodos gráficos para interpretar as relações de estresse-deformação e determinar o módulo elástico para cada tipo de osso. Esta pesquisa demonstrou habilidades em design experimental, testes avançados de materiais, coleta e análise de dados, modelagem computacional e aplicação de princípios mecânicos a biomateriais.",
