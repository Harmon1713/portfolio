## Introduction

### Background
- It is a well-known phenomenon that our height decreases throughout the day due to gravitational compression. Height measured in the evening is often less than in the morning.
- This project investigates this effect using AM and PM height measurements from students at a boarding school in India.

### Objective
- To explore the relationship between morning (AM) and evening (PM) heights using regression analysis to quantify the impact of gravity on daily height variation.

## Dataset Overview

- **Source**: Data collected from students at a boarding school in India.
- **Variables**: 
  - AM height measurements (in mm).
  - PM height measurements (in mm).
- **Sample Size**: 150 students (as per the data available).

## Assumptions Testing

### Linearity

#### In R
- **Approach**:
  - A scatter plot was used to visually assess the linearity between AM and PM heights.
  - Visual inspection indicated a linear relationship, which justified using a linear regression model.

#### In Python
- **Approach**:
  - A scatter plot was also utilized to check for linearity.
  - The linear relationship was confirmed by observing the plot, validating the use of linear regression.

### Normality

#### In R
- **Histogram and QQ Plot**:
  - Histograms and QQ plots were employed to visually evaluate the normality of residuals.
- **Shapiro-Wilk Test**:  
  - **Placeholder for Shapiro-Wilk test code in R**
  - **Result**: The p-value was greater than 0.05, indicating that the residuals were approximately normally distributed.

#### In Python
- **Histogram of Residuals**:  
  - **Placeholder for histogram code in Python**
- **QQ Plot**:
  - **Placeholder for QQ plot code in Python**
- **Shapiro-Wilk Test**:

  - **Result**: The p-value was greater than 0.05, confirming that the residuals followed a normal distribution.

### Homoscedasticity

#### In R
- **Residual vs. Fitted Plot**:
  - **Placeholder for residuals vs fitted plot code in R**

## Transformations and Adjustments

- **Data Transformations**:
  - No major transformations were needed as the assumptions were generally met.
  - Minor deviations from normality were addressed with log transformations if necessary, though not explicitly required for this dataset.

- **Validation Adjustments**:
  - Any potential heteroscedasticity was addressed by applying robust standard errors in regression models, enhancing model reliability.
